'''
Note:
When using stacks and queues, you can use dot
notation or static method notation to do the same thing.

Ex:
Let Q be a Queue
Q.dequeue() is equivalent to dequeue(Q)
Q.enqueue(x) is equivalent to enqueue(Q)

This works for all stack methods, and methods shared between stacks
and queues such as isEmpty and size
